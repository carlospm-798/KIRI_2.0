Homemade 6-degree-of-freedom robotic arm available for free.

Note that the "Main" branch is empty, as this project is progressing in my free time, 
but you can check out the development experiments in the different branches available. 
"Main" is reserved only for code that is ready to be tested with the most hardware, 
software, and arm available.
